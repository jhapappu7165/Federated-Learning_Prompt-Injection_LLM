# Federated Prompt Injection Detection in LLMs

> ⚠️ This project is currently under active research and development. All implementations, models, and evaluations will be added progressively.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This research investigates a **novel approach to detecting prompt injection attacks in Large Language Models (LLMs)** through the use of **federated learning**, allowing multiple organizations to collaborate on securing LLMs without compromising data privacy.

The project aims to address a critical security vulnerability — **prompt injection** — while preserving organizational confidentiality through decentralized machine learning.

## 🧪 Research Objectives

- 📌 Enable organizations to detect prompt injection **without sharing private prompts**.
- 🛡️ Combine **federated learning** with novel **adversarial prompt detection techniques**.
- 🧠 Implement **privacy-preserving methods** such as differential privacy and secure aggregation.
- 📊 Evaluate robustness, detection accuracy, and privacy utility tradeoffs.
